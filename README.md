#deez.js

A minimal library targeted for lightweight, responsive applications.

This project is still in it's infancy, so there are likely still some kinks here and there. In addition, I've only added features as the need arose, so if it's missing some specific functionality which might be useful, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Installation

Documentation to come shortly.
